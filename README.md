# CS470-

CS470 Game Development Final Project
You will work together in teams of 5-6 people to develop your own video game using the Unity Game Engine
as shown in class. Each person on the team will take on one of the indie game developer roles discussed in class
to get a feel for separation of responsibilities in game development. Every person on the team is still responsible
for some coding responsibilities.
Your game must meet the following requirements:
 Must fit one of the genres discussed in class (at least partially) and have the attributes of that genre
 Must be unique with innovative gameplay (not just copy and paste of someone else’s work)
 Must have a single player mode
 Must be developed in Unity
 Must be feasible to complete before the due date
In addition to your game you must write up the following documentation
 Concept Document
 Gameplay Specification
 Design/Architecture Specification
 Weekly reports (formed as a group) reflecting what goals were set for the week,
the responsibilities assigned to each member, and a reflection on the previous week analyzing if goals
were met
 Daily Progress Logs (formed individually for each member of the group) detailing what steps were
taken that day to work on the responsibilities assigned to them that week
 Post Mortem
 Game Manual
You can refer to our first lecture for a breakdown of what we will be looking for and how your project will be
graded.
What to turn in:
- Soft copy of the entire program (the entire project folder created by Unity in a compressed file) submitted to
Blackboard
- Copy of your Documentations to Blackboard (can be zipped if need be as well)
